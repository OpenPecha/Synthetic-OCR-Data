# Synthetic-OCR-Data


1. "hard training data" - images of lines transcribed manually or semi-automatically (line to text)
   - Lhasa kangyur 10 batches
   - Queenie's data about 2 million page images
       - we have the google OCRed etext proofread and BDRC page images
3. Synthetic data generated with fonts where we generate the images from Unicode text
4. Synthetic data generated with fonts specially created for this using glyphs automatically extracted from scanned images
5. Synthetic data generated with style transfer (i.e. taking a modern printed page and turning it into a synthetic woodblock page by transferring the style from woodblock images)
